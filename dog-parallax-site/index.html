            These are some cute dogs that are just posing for the camera. They love getting their pictures taken. You'll
            Wish You Could Cuddle All the Time. We think these pups deserve some recognition for being incredibly
            adorable.

        <h2>Cuteness is a state of being.</h2>
        <p>
            Puppies are definitely getting the 'cute response' these two are the cutest things in the whole wide world,
            of course. Chillin, clever, soft and cuddly, best friends sitting together waiting to be petted and loved.
            Strangers falling in love as soon as they meet them. So loyal to their people, through and through.
